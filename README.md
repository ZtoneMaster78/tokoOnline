Hello there!
I don't know why you're here but I can't blame you for your curiousity

This is one of my college assignment. Below is the instructions

Create a program for a simple online store. The program must have the following features:

- Display a list of items and prices:
  "T-shirt" - Rp50,000
  "Jacket" - Rp150,000
  "Hat" - Rp30,000
  
- Ask the user to select the desired item and quantity
- Calculate the total price of the purchased items
- Give a 10% discount if the total price is more than Rp200,000
- Display the total to be paid after the discount (if it fulfills the requirement)

Code the program in Python and add comments to explain each step
